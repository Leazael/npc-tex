\specialability{Intrument Dependant}{ex}{Can use spells with somatic components with a hand that is holding a (part of a) musical instrument. Must use instrument for bardic performances with audible components.}

\specialability{Subtle Performance}{ex}{Observers do not automatically recognize bardic performances as anything other than ordinary performance. Those specifically looking for abnormal effects must succeed at a DC 14 Sense Motive check to detect their performances.}

\labelcategory{𝄢}{Bardic performances [14 rounds/day]}

\secondary{Can be used 8 + 2×level + Cha rounds per day (incl. extra performance).}

\secondary{Starting a bardic performance is a standard action and maintained as a free action. It cannot be disturbed but ends immediately if the bard is killed, paralyzed, stunned, unconscious or otherwise prevented from taking a free action. A bard cannot have more than one bardic performance in effect at one time. A deaf bard has a 20\% chance to fail an audible performance. A blind bard has a 50\% chance to fail a visual performance.}

\secondary{All instrumentalist's bardic performances must be accompanied by an instrument, even if they soleley rely on visual components.}

\specialability{Countersong}{Su}{Each round make a Perform (keyboard, percussion, wind, string) check, any creature within 30 ft. by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the perform result in place of their saving throw. Any creature already under the affect of such an attack gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bards result for the save. (Relies on audible components.)}

\specialability{Fascinate}{Su}{Creatures within 90 feet, able to hear, see, (and be seen by the bard), and capable of paying attention become fascinated. DC 14 Will negats and renders creature immune to the performance for 24 hours. Fascinate is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability. (Relies on audible and visible components.)}

\specialability{Inspire Courage}{Su}{Targets able to perciesve the bards performance receive a a +1 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls, and a +1 morale bonus on saves vs. charm and fear effects. Inspire courage is a mind affecting ability. (Relies on audible or visible components.)}

\labelcategory{𝄢}{Dissonant performance}

\secondary{Dissonant performance is a type of bardic performance. For the duration of the performance, invoke a dissonance as a standard action. Alternatively, when starting the performance as a standard action, spend an additional round of bardic performance to immediately invoke a dissonance.}

\secondary{Dissonant performance and dissonants rely on audible components, but still affect deaf creatures. Only targets within the effect of a silence are immune.}

\specialability{Cacophonous Chord}{Sp}{As a standard action, spend 1 round of bardic performance to create a 10 ft. radius burst at close range (25 ft.), dealing 1d6 sonic damage (DC 14 Fort halfves). This is an evocation (sonic) effect.}
